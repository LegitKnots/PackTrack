Route Sharing - Button the share a route doesnt do anything except continue to prompt sharing enabling


Route Deatils screen needs to be finished, ill focus on that now

once you login, its possible to slide from left to right and go back to the login and signup page, this should NOT be possible

Notifications on dashboard show the full JSON constents instead of formatting it properly
